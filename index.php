            <h3>Natural habitats</h3>
            <p> Natural habitats are one of the most fascinating parts of the natural world because they show how every species fits into an environment that supports its survival. When zoos
               talk about “natural habitats,” they’re usually referring to the ecosystems they try to recreate for animals — but the idea starts with how these habitats work in the wild.</p>

            <h3>Animal enclosures & habitats  </h3>
            <p> Animal enclosures and habitats in zoos are designed to provide a safe and comfortable environment for the animals while also allowing visitors to observe and learn about them. These
               enclosures are carefully planned to mimic the animals' natural habitats as closely as possible, taking into account factors such as space, vegetation, water sources, and shelter.</p>
